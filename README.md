# Encryption machine

## How it works

This is a program that encrypts files. It uses a cipher called the "polyalphabetic cipher," which is essentially just each letter being changed by a certain amount.

Each letter is converted to a number, and each number is then added by the same value. That is how a ceaser cipher works. However, the polyalphabetic cipher alters each letter by a differenct amount.

So, when you input the "key" of numbers, each letter is added to buy a different digit from the number. It's not the most secure cipher, but the longer the number is, the harder it is to encrypt.

THIS IS A VERY WEAK CIPHER THAT CAN BE BROKEN

The only way to make this more and more secure is if I was able to make an infinitely long number that's entirely random and being able to add each number by a value greater than 9.

## How to use it

You don't need to know how it works to use it. It should be very self explanatory. The "key" is the only value that will fully decipher and encrypt your message, so it's important to remember it.

That's all you need to do. If somebody has the "key" that you use, which is just a number of any size, then they can decode the messages that you encrypted with the same key.




There's very little chance that anyboyd will see this and care, so I'm probably just writing this for my future self to see.
